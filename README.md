# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## The Task

This week, we started with a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to save book searches to the back end. 

## The Final Website:
https://bookfinderbrandon2.herokuapp.com/


### Build Notes

Requirements on the Back End to make the site work:

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.

* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.

* `Schemas` directory:

	* `index.js`: Export your typeDefs and resolvers.

	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.

	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:

		* `Query` type:

			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type.
		
		* `Mutation` type:

			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type.
			
			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
			
		* `User` type:

			* `_id`

			* `username`

			* `email`

			* `bookCount`

			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)

		* `Book` type:

			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)

			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)

			* `description`

			* `title`

			* `image`

			* `link`

		* `Auth` type:

			* `token`

			* `user` (References the `User` type.)


### Front-End Specifications

Requirements on the Front End for the site to work:

* `queries.js`: This will hold the query `GET_ME`, which will execute the `me` query set up using Apollo Server.

* `mutations.js`:

	* `LOGIN_USER` will execute the `loginUser` mutation set up using Apollo Server.

	* `ADD_USER` will execute the `addUser` mutation.

	* `SAVE_BOOK` will execute the `saveBook` mutation.

	* `REMOVE_BOOK` will execute the `removeBook` mutation.

* `App.js`: Create an Apollo Provider to make every request work with the Apollo Server.
	
* `SearchBooks.js`:

	* Use the Apollo `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `SAVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleSaveBook()` function instead of the `saveBook()` function imported from the `API` file.


* `SavedBooks.js`:

	* Remove the `useEffect()` Hook that sets the state for `UserData`.

	* Instead, use the `useQuery()` Hook to execute the `GET_ME` query on load and save it to a variable named `userData`.

	* Use the `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `REMOVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleDeleteBook()` function instead of the `deleteBook()` function that's imported from `API` file. (Make sure you keep the `removeBookId()` function in place!)

* `SignupForm.js`: Replace the `addUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `ADD_USER` mutation functionality.

* `LoginForm.js`: Replace the `loginUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `LOGIN_USER` mutation functionality.


## Challenges

Building the app was certainly difficult, and presented many challenges when it came to recaftoring the code. It was important for me (and will be for any developer looking to recreate this project) to be mindeful of your package.json installs, and the Middleware functions that need to work. Also, when deploying to Heroku, if you run into any errors, try creating the app within Heroku directly and linking to your repo. If you see further errors, try running throught he Heroku logs, and the error messages may point you where you need to go!
